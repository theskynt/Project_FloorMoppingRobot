--------------------
WARNING:Pack:2609 - SmartGuide is more efficient (better guiding and runtime)
   when used with explicit timing constraints. If you want the full benefit of
   the SmartGuide flow, please add timing constraints to your design, then
   re-create your guide file.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:980 - The following NGM file is used during SmartGuide: "E:\Xilinx
   Project\FPGA_SENSOR\fpga_test_map.ngm". The NGM file contains information on
   how the guide file was originally mapped. It is required for the best
   SmartGuide results.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   9 block(s) removed
  13 block(s) optimized away
  11 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_71" (AND) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_6/XLXN_89" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_70/XLXI_2" (FF) removed.
   The signal "XLXI_6/XLXI_70/XLXN_3" is loadless and has been removed.
    Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_70/XLXI_4" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_6/XLXN_88" is loadless and has been removed.

   The signal "XLXI_6/XLXI_70/XLXN_4" is loadless and has been removed.
    Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_70/XLXI_5" (BUF) removed.

   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

Section 8 - Guide Report
------------------------

Tue Dec 14 18:41:38 2021

  Estimated SmartGuide Results
  ----------------------------
  This section describes the guide results after placement. Re-implemented 
  components are components that were guided, but moved in order to satisfy
  timing requirements.

    Estimated Percentage of guided Components                 | 100.0%
    Estimated Percentage of re-implemented Components         |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of new/changed Components            |   0.0%
    Estimated Percentage of fully guided Nets                 |  99.3%
    Estimated Percentage of partially guided or unrouted Nets |   0.7%

  A detailed SmartGuide report (.GRF) can be generated during PAR by
  specifying the [-smartguide <guidefile[.ncd]>] switch on the PAR
  command line. The GRF file contains all components and nets that were
  not guided. A final summary report is always generated and is available
  in the PAR report file and in the GRF regardless of the PAR -smartguide switch.


Section 9 - Area Group and Partition Summary
--------------------------------------------

Partition Implementation Status
-------------------------------

  No Partitions were found in this design.

Area Group Information
----------------------

  No area groups were found in this design.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
